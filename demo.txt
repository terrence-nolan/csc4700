What is your favorite movie?
I'm never able to pick just one but I'll say Goodwill Hunting for this.

If you could go anywhere in the world for vacation, where would it be?
The Amalfi Coast: one of the few places I didn't get to when I was abroad in Italy.

If you could have any super power, what would it be (and why that power)?
Teleportation because then I would be able to fulfill my answer above. 
I think time travel would also be cool but if you can't teleport when you time travel than I don't think you could see much.
